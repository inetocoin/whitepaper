INETO White Paper 2018

### Problem Statement

Bitcoin was the first solution of distributed database, Etherum was the first smart-contract platform that built on the same principles as Bitcoin. All other altcoins have similar features or even the same code-base therefore they are in the same (first) generation of the distributed databases. 

First generation has the folowing problems:
* single blockchain
* unlimited blocks in blockchain
* no trash collectors
* simple consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS)
* use hard forks for bug-fixing
* no KYC and AML

All thouse problems lead to the limited TPS (Transactions Per Second), vertical scaling and unlimited hard forks

### Vision

### Fees

Bitcoin fees are calculated per transaction between miner and sender on market basis. In reality every transaction that miner creates is supported by all nodes. So, in contrary to Bitcoin whereas market is between current miner and a sender, in reality there is a market between networks and a sender. Finally, sender selects network to transfer value with lesser fees.

For network perspective, size of transaction and execution costs are almost constant and does not depend on amount. So, basically price that sender pays for the transaction must not depend on amount, and probably can depend on sender itself.

The goal is to achieve in distributed network effect, whereas trustfully accounts would be able to achieve zero fees.

So, basically it creates requirement of keeping transaction history of account and their scoring.
