White Paper


### Problem Statement

Bitcoin was the first solution of distributed database, Etherum was the first smart-contract platform that built on the same principles as Bitcoin. All other altcoins have similar features or even the same code-base therefore they are in the same (first) generation of the distributed databases. 

First generation has the folowing problems:
* single blockchain
* unlimited blocks in blockchain
* no trash collectors
* simple consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS)
* use hard forks for bug-fixing
* no KYC and AML

All thouse problems lead to the limited TPS (Transactions Per Second), vertical scaling and unlimited hard forks
