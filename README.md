INETO White Paper 2018

### Problem Statement

Bitcoin was the first solution of distributed database, Etherum was the first smart-contract platform that built on the same principles as Bitcoin. All other altcoins have similar features or even the same code-base therefore they are in the same (first) generation of the distributed databases. 

First generation has the folowing problems:
* single blockchain
* unlimited blocks in blockchain
* no trash collectors
* simple consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS)
* use hard forks for bug-fixing
* no KYC and AML

All thouse problems lead to the limited TPS (Transactions Per Second), vertical scaling and unlimited hard forks

### Vision

### Sliding blockchain

### Sharding


### Fees

Bitcoin fees are calculater per transaction on market basis. In reality every transaction that miner creates is supported by all nodes. So, in contrary to Bitcoin whereas market is between current miner and a sender, in reality there is a market between network and a sender.
